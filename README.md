# hello, Daniel is on the line

before you start reviewing the homework, I'd like to point out that there are **only** two options.

in the first option, only the division function works, and the remaining arithmetic signs are just for show (or so I initially thought).

however, I realized that this wasn't enough and that it was becoming increasingly useless in this program, so I created the second option â€“ it's more comprehensive in its selection of arithmetic operations.

(btw, all of this is compiled using VS Code, so there won't be any extra files from the usual and beloved Visual Studio lol)
